            <h2>Introduction- Breaking the silence as our culture, history and identity is being erased</h2>
            <p> The face of Tamil Oppression is the Tamil Genocide, 18 May 2009 in Mullivaikkal, which led to the ending of the Civil War (1983-2009). In 2009, within 5 months, more than 40,000 civilians were massacred (believed to be 100,000), 146,000 Tamils became unaccounted and 25,000 children became orphans.
<br> This is only an introduction.

<h2><br><br>HISTORY
</h2>
<p>There was initially little tension between the Sinhalese and Tamils, though this tension only served to increase after British decolonisation. The first appointed representative of Sinhalese and Tamils, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam (Tamil), became a part of the -soon after- newly created ‘Colombo Seat’ which alternated between Tamils and Sinhalese, for a more ‘communal representation’. Discrimination against Tamils grew in power through political and thus ‘official’ means:
  <br><br> In 1948, immediately after independence, the Ceylon Citizenship Act was passed, deliberately discriminating against the Indian Tamil ethnic minority and making it impossible for them to obtain citizenship in ‘Sri Lanka’ - this led to approximately 700,000 Indian Tamils being made stateless, and more than 300,000 Indian Tamils being deported back to India over a period of 30 years. It wasn’t until 2003 that Indian Tamils living in Sri Lanka were granted citizenship, but by this time they only made up 5% of the island’s population; in 1956, the Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranike passed the “Sinhala Only Act” which replaced English with Sinhala as the only official language of the country; during the 1970s, the Policy of Standardization was initiated. This required Tamil students to gain higher marks than Sinhalese students to gain admission to universities, reducing the numbers of Tamil students who had previously, based on their examination scores alone, gained admission in a higher proportion than their participation in the examination. This policy was ‘abandoned’ in 1977.
<br><br>The LTTE fought for the creation of a secular, socialist state of Tamil Eelam, based on the right of self determination. As a repressed minority, we rose to fight for our freedom: No one was listening to our pleas for help, yet everyone was hearing our screams.
</p>

<h2>OUR DIFFERENCES</h2>
  <p> Our differences should not divide us but unite us.  <br><br>
‘Sri Lanka is a Buddhist Sinhala Country’ they say (BBS’ secretary general, Galgoda Aththe Gnasara who heads the Buddhist group, 2020), as they ethnically cleanse the Tamil minority with massacres, genocides, cultural cleanses and continued oppression. <br><br>
Tamil is the first oldest language, so how is it, whilst it makes sense for different ethnicities to come from or have their own land, that we do not have a land of our own? *with awareness that Indian Tamils have a state in India called Tamil Nadu.
Tamils are the aboriginal native inhabitants of Eelam (the island currently known as ‘Sri Lanka’). Surface research will deny this- it will not mention the ancient history of the island (‘Sri Lanka’) and only start history from the arrival of the Sinhalese from North East India as a means to fabricate and hide the ancient history that reveals that Eelam Tamils are the indigenous inhabitants of the Island. They have already altered and are continuing to alter our history to benefit them.
<br><br>I recommend you to research about the Jaffna Kingdom and the Nagas tribe for a start.</p>
<p id="red">“Eelam Tamils are members of the Tamil ethnic group native to the South Asian Island state of Sri Lanka”,  “the foremost theory of the descendants of modern Eelam Tamils descend from the residents of Jaffna Kingdom.”  Jaffna Kingdom is recognised as a Tamil region in the name Demala-pattana; it was established as a powerful force in the north, north east and west of the Island (right now, 70% of Eelam Tamils in ‘Sri Lanka’ live in the Northern and Eastern provinces) and from early to mid 14th century, the Jaffna Kingdom was an ascendant power in the island, when all regional kingdoms accepted subordination. It was then overpowered by the rival Kotte Kingdom, but in 1467 was freed of Kotte control. During this period of restoring and strengthening  economic position, important local Tamil Literature was produced…
<br><br>Please also research the Nagas, an ancient tribe who once inhabited ‘Sri Lanka’. Naga means snake/serpent in Sanskrit, Pali and Tamil (more context with research). It is also postulated that the Nagas are the aboriginal tribe of Sri Lanka… who started to assimilate to Tamil Culture and Language from the 3rd BCE… (Websites for further research will be linked below). The ancestors of Sinhalese people settled on the island in the 6th century BCE. </p>
<p>On June 1, 1981, two hundred officers of the Sri Lankan Police Force, under the supervision of two senior Sri Lankan Cabinet Ministers, burnt the Jaffna Public Library to the ground. The library was one of the biggest libraries in Asia at the time of its destruction, built lovingly by the citizens of Jaffna and well-wishers with no government assistance whatsoever. The Burning of the Jaffna Public Library destroyed evidence for the history of the island: 97,000 books, including irreplaceable manuscripts written on palm leaves, original copies of important historic documents in the contested political history of Sri lanka and newspapers that were published hundreds of years ago were destroyed.  ‘That day all Tamils lost a piece of themselves’ - a piece that we will never get back. I must also include the death of  Fr. Hyacinth Singaraya David from a heart attack upon hearing the news of the burning of the Jaffna Public Library. (The burning of the Jaffna Public Library* is a huge cultural genocide, destroying a lot of our history and treasured works, and I encourage you to research about Father Hyacinth Singaraya David* (website linked below).
<br><br>Eelam Tamils roam this planet with our identities being erased, originating from merely the ‘corner of the world’ (‘Sri Lanka’). Tamils have no home of their own, despite its ancient culture and language; our oldest culture, rich in history and knowledge, is slowly being silenced.
</p>
<h2>PRESENT OPPRESSION</h2>
<p>
  Despite this search for knowledge on nationality and origins, in a perfect world and hopefully in the future, our differences shouldn’t divide us but unite us.
This violence against Tamils starts from before the civil war, including the 1956 Gal Oya Riots (one of many that were carried out in 1958, called the ‘58 Riots’) in which thousands of Tamil civilians perished, and this oppression still continues to this day.
<br>In recent months, increased militarization across the North-East (tamil dominated areas) is being exploited, increasing Sri Lankan state violence, where Tamils are being murdered: on 21 Sunday June, 2020, a 24-year-old Tamil man, Thiraviyam Ramalingham, was shot for ‘apprehension over reported illegal sand mining’ dying on the scene or after being left untreated in hospital for at least forty-five minutes; on 1 May, 2020, three Tamil women were left hospitalised from the brutal assaults of the Sri Lankan police; on 22 April 2020, drunk police officers severely injured Tamil youngsters and fishermen in an unprovoked attack.
<br><br>The government gets away with oppressing and murdering Tamil people, whether it be unheard or blatantly recognised by the United Nations. It is in our hands to fight against this systematic oppression, that will otherwise wipe out our history, culture and roots. Books, pens, voices, the truth and justice, and solidarity are our weapons. And for a better world.
It is hard to see peace in the near future, and I am aware that change does not come immediately, but we can work together to change the future. This isn’t about seeking ‘justice’ for a civil war that ended 11 years ago. This is our continued fight for freedom. Oppression continues in many forms from big to small and has directly impacted all or at least the huge majority of the Tamil diaspora, including my roots.
Governments around the world are corrupt, but the future changes with us.
<h2>Final Note</h2>
<p> I use ‘Sri Lanka’ in speech marks because is is the name given to the island by our oppressors and the government, thus representing the oppression of Tamils and their discrimination against us. Eelam is the indigenous name of the island now named ‘Sri Lanka’.
Disclaimer: As a Tamil bearing their parents’ pains that comes directly from the oppression and civil war in Sri Lanka, I write passionately about our oppressions and unjust cleansing of our identity as Tamils from the island.
<br><br>I, myself, also have a lot to learn and to listen to more perspectives. I have also not addressed everything about Tamil Oppression and the Civil War but have tried to summarise in a nutshell. I apologise if I have omitted anything that should have been said in this summary of an introduction. I have tried to explain everything to the best I could from my position and my parents’ struggles, like many others. With more knowledge I will become wiser and connect to more people with similar or different perspectives, on a human level.
I would also like to highlight that I haven’t included what little of the comradeship there was and is between Tamils and some Sinhalese and the acknowledgements to some Sinhalese and other ethnicities who had helped Tamils and those who acknowledge our oppression as well as act against it. This blog is not about rivalling with Sinhalese; it is addressing the oppression carried out by the Sri Lankan government and its followers who are striving to make ‘Sri Lanka’ a ‘Buddhist Sinhala country’.
<br><br>I acknowledge that my blog emphasises the importance of identity, land and nationality as a means to explain our oppression but I do not want this to distract from the cause of the civil war and the reason for this blog: our fight for freedom and equality.

The main aim here is for a better world, finding peace within the Island between the different cultures as well as finding peace across the globe for all causes, including other minorities’ justice. Change starts with us. We are the future. It is important that we educate ourselves on ALL causes, (the root of this platform), learn to love ourselves and learn and practice kindness to spread to others, and work towards a better future, together.
