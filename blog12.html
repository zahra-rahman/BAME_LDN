            <p> Nationalists and reactionaries across Britain seem awfully nostalgic for the British Empire. Its legacy, they say, is being squandered by the ‘regressive left’ and ‘dangerous organisations’ such as Black Lives Matter. I would, strangely, agree that the legacy of the Empire is paramount. So then, let’s take a look at a place where its legacy is thriving: Pakistan.</p>
          </div>
<h2>Bhutto and the Bengalis.</h2>
<p>In 1970, the first democratic election was held in Pakistan, in which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League won a landslide victory against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s People’s Party (PPP). Rahman did not, however, win a single seat in ‘West Pakistan’—the Western half of the nation composed of every province except East Bengal, which was located on the other side of India. Citing this factor, the PPP claimed that the Awami League—despite having an absolute majority of 161 seats—could not rule in West Pakistan.
 	<br><br>Rahman, in his election manifesto, had proposed a 6-point plan for the independence of East Bengal and the creation of a new nation called ‘Bangladesh’. This had energised the Bengali masses, who rallied in favour of independence. Many of these protests were brutally put down by the Pakistan Army, unbeknownst to Bhutto, who was attempting to start talks with Rahman, and a flood of refugees from the East Bengal came into West Bengal in India. Indira Gandhi—the leader of the Indian National Congress and the Prime Minister of India—decided that it would be more economical to go to war with Pakistan than to take in more refugees, and so she funded East Bengali militant groups, before actively sending Indian troops to fight for Bangladesh.
</p>

<h2>Fair Play.</h2>
<p>The loss of East Pakistan was a humiliating setback to the bourgeois reactionary military establishment, which, less than a decade later, launched ‘Operation Fair Play’—the 1979 U.S.-backed coup in which Chief of Army Staff General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq deposed the Bhutto administration and declared martial law for ninety days. He stayed for eleven years.
 <br><br>	Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged for alleged treason, his son-in-law Asif Ali Zardari was made a political prisoner, and his daughter Benazir Bhutto led the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD). This period was perhaps the most tyrannical in Pakistan’s history, with a fascist government enforcing religious persecution and discrimination between various Islamic sects.
</p>

<h2>
  Neo-colonial Control.</h2>

  <p>In 1949, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin sent an invitation to Liaquat Ali Khan (the first Prime Minister of Pakistan) to visit the U.S.S.R. Shortly after, U.S. President Truman also sent an invitation, in response to the Soviet move. Khan chose to visit the United States in 1950, and severed ties with the Soviet Union.

 <br><br>	At first, Pakistani foreign policy was to remain neutral in the Cold War, and to move towards the Non-Aligned Movement. However, economic problems soon arose, and Khan requested aid from the U.S.A., beginning Pakistan’s dependence and subordination to the West. From thereon out, the Army began to take orders from the C.I.A., ending any realistic possibility of an elected Pakistani government downsizing it, with Pakistan being an essential capitalist pawn against the ‘spread of Communism’, ignoring the atrocities committed by said Army in East Pakistan, most notably those mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Blood#The_Blood_telegram">Blood Telegram </a> . In fact, the United States would go to great lengths to secure the sovereignty of the Pakistani state, such as during the Bangladesh Liberation War, when it, the U.K. and France supplied the nation with military equipment, with the President Richard Nixon even considering military action against India .


<br><br>The U.S.A. relied heavily on both the Pakistan Army and government, using it as a vessel to fund terrorist groups such as the Mujahedeen and Osama bin Laden’s Maktab al-Khidamat to destabilise and overthrow the elected socialist government of the Democratic Republic of Afhghanistan. Of course, it was not just the Afghan government which was overthrown—General Zia ul-Haq was sponsored by the United States of America to take illegally, undemocratically seize power and to unconditionally support its relentless attacks on Afghani sovereignty.

 	<br><br>What went around, did, however, come around, when the Islamist groups turned against the U.S., beginning the War on Terror, during which it once again utilised Pakistan as a military vessel, once again backed a military coup, and once again funded an illegitimate military government to fight America’s war in Afghanistan. This time, however, there was no Afghan government to bring down; now, the enemies were the terrorist groups, set up and funded by the United States, now being fought against not because of their abhorrent fascism or of their murders of civilians across the world, but simply because they were now a threat to the economic interests of the capitalist elite.
</p>

<h2>
  No change.</h2>

  <p>Now, we are brought back to today. The military establishment is as powerful as ever, enforced disappearances are a common occurrence, and elected governments act on the whim of the Pakistan Army (which is still operated by the Central Intelligence Agency). All because of a few, hasty decisions by the British in their urge to leave India as quickly as possible; decisions driven by divisions emboldened and petrified by them in order to easily rule over their most precious colony. </p>
