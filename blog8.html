<h2><br><br> ‘I can’t breathe.’</h2>
<p>
  Since mid-March (although later in the U.S.A.), people have been locked indoors. For almost all people, there has appeared a sudden lack of immediate purpose, causing us, as a collective, to look more closely both at ourselves and at the society in which we live. Countless people have lost their jobs during lockdown, causing a whole new wave of working-class folks to examine the various injustices of the global neoliberal economies.
 	<br><br>Amidst this radical re-evaluation of our society, we are shocked to find that CoViD-19 has a disproportionate impact on black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (BAME). There has been speculation on the differences in the levels of certain vitamins in black and white people, but any evidence is still inconclusive in explaining why, according to the U.K. Office of National Statistics, BAME people are a shocking four times more likely to die from the disease than white people. In light of these findings, an atmosphere of questioning existing institutions and their inequalities was developing.
 	<br><br>Then, on the 25th of May, 2020, George Perry Floyd Jr. was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis. His final sentence, “I can’t breathe,” struck a collective nerve; for months, people were dying, unable to breathe, due to an uncontrollable virus, and communities lived in fear of contracting it, and suffering the same fate. Now, yet another person was unable to breathe, but this time the virus was not alien and unbeatable; this virus was one which pervaded through human civilisation, against which no vaccine is being developed—the virus of the system, and all the inequalities it creates.
</p>
<h2>A different kind of virus.</h2>
<p>Discrimination of some kind has existed since the invention of the state, and the transition into feudalism (with the very first form being the subjugation of the female sex in the family unit). As reactionary ideologies became rooted in the very heart of human civilisation, those subjugated by the unfettered greed of capital accumulation were designated by the ruling classes to be naturally inferior. The Irish to the English in the early feudal age, the Amerindian to the European in the so-called Age of Discovery, and the non-white to the white in the culmination of imperial conquest and the post-colonial world.
 	<br><br>Throughout history, human greed has been the perpetrator of discriminatory narratives, but how would we, as young activists, go about creating real change within the system in which we reside?</p>

<h2>The struggle.</h2>
<p>Obviously, we cannot change the world in one go. Accordingly, our struggle must take place on different levels, both gradually and radically. The nature of our struggle must also be malleable, and suited to the conditions of whichever kind of society we find ourselves in.
 	<br><br>The first and simplest thing we can do is to challenge racist narratives. People hear this phrase all the time, and seem to not properly understand what it means, so let’s just get this clear: you hear someone say something with racist undertones, and you talk to them. It is important not to instantly declare them to be a racist because they may have said it out of genuine ignorance, in which case you referring to them as such may push them towards conscious racism. What we need to do is open dialogue with people who hold unknowingly racist views, because, let’s be honest—how many racists actually know they’re being racist? These people need to be spoken to, and, whenever necessary, re-educated. Many people hold bigoted views about things like immigration due to the narrative set by the right-wing media, and so we must set our own counter-narrative and explain it to as many people possible.
 <br><br>	However, for how long can we simply challenge racism? It will be challenged, it will die down, and it will re-emerge in one way or the other—how can we break this cycle? To do this, we need to educate ourselves and others on the inseparable links between class and race, and how a hate-driven system uses identity politics to divide the working-class. This link will almost inevitably transpire as we live our lives as active anti-racists, just as it has done for black rights activists across history. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., for example, started his journey towards black liberation in the United States along purely racial lines, but eventually came to the conclusion that, “the system will not change the rules, [so] we are going to have to change the system.”
