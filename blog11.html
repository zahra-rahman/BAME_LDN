            <p>Nationalists and reactionaries across Britain seem awfully nostalgic for the British Empire.
Its legacy, they say, is being squandered by the ‘regressive left’ and ‘dangerous
organisations’ such as Black Lives Matter. I would, strangely, agree that the legacy of the
Empire is paramount. So then, let’s take a look at a place where its legacy is thriving:
Pakistan.</p>

<h2><br><br> Democracy Arrested.</h2>
<p>In the early hours of the fifteenth of July, Muhammad Amin, a student activist, was kidnapped from his home in Karachi by the Rangers—a paramilitary force of the Pakistani government. There was no legal warrant for his arrest, and there appears to be no crime which has been committed; Amin was abducted to an unknown location simply because he dared to challenge the status-quo by demanding free education and students’ rights in Pakistan, which was inconvenient for the reactionary military establishment.
 	<br><br>This is not the first time something like this has happened, and, unfortunately, it will almost certainly not be the last. The Pakistan Army is, in effect, the governing organisation of Pakistan, and has been since the nation’s inception, often through direct rule, with the last military dictatorship having only ended in 2008. How did the Pakistan Army become so dangerously influential in Pakistan, unlike the Indian Army, which, despite having originated from the same British Indian Army, has remained a meritocracy and stayed out of political affairs?
</p>

<h2>The Crown Jewel of the Empire.</h2>
<p>The answer to this question lies within the British Raj (Raj meaning rule; this is the term used to describe the 200 years of British rule in India), and in the very foundations of the Pakistani state.
 	<br><br>	No country spent a larger percentage of its budget on its military than British India. Indian troops were invaluable to the British, be they in Afghanistan to be used against the Russians (tales of the bravery of Sikh soldiers holding the line despite being severely outnumbered by Russo-Afghan forces are numerous), or in Europe against the Germans (Indians made up over 60% if the British Imperial Army in the First World War). These Indian troops, paid for by Indian taxes, were used by the British for British imperialist interests.
</p>

<h2>Divide and Rule.</h2>
<p>In 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded by Allan Octavian Hume—a radical member of the Imperial Civil Service who never hesitated to question British policy in India. It was set up to provide more effective governance in India so as to prevent a repeat of the 1857 War of Independence (derogatorily termed the ‘Sepoy Mutiny’ by the British), but it grew to be the main voice for India to become a, “sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic,” {Indian Constitution} free from imperial rule. Its notable members included several notable Muslim figures, such as Maulana Azad and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
 <br>	In 1906, the All-India Muslim League was founded after British instigation, but ended up as a small, insignificant party purely made to ensure that the British did not ignore Muslim voices. Its first president was the moderate Aga Khan, who ensured co-operation between the League and the Congress, with the membership of both parties not being mutually exclusive (in fact, several leaders of the Muslim League also presided over Congress, often at the same time.). The Muslim League was practically the Muslim wing of the Congress Party.
<br><br>However, with the threat of a united independence movement becoming too large, the British sought to divide it, by declaring the Indian National Congress to be a Hindu party, and funding the right-wing of the Muslim League to create a separate, Muslim party. Muhammad Ali Jinnah—a member of the Congress until 1920, and a member of the League since 1913—became the president of the Muslim League and the main voice for Islamic nationalism, with a declaration being made in 1933 for a separate Muslim state in India called ‘Pakistan’.
 <br>	Pakistan was not, at least initially, intended to be a separate nation altogether; early visions saw a sort of devolved administration of Muslim-majority states within an independent India. The majority of Indian Muslims saw this as unnecessary, and the League performed terribly in the British Indian elections, with the Congress winning almost all Hindu seats as well as the vast majority of Muslim seats, despite the keen efforts of the British administration to divide Indians based of race, religion and caste (perhaps one of the most desperate attempts of division was when the electoral was segregated by faith, with Hindus only able to vote for Hindu candidates, Muslims only for Muslim candidates, Christians for Christians and so on and so on).
</p>

<h2>The Pakistan Project.</h2>
<p>In the 1930s, several ill-thought out campaigns by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and others led to the mass-arrests of Congress leaders. In this time, the Muslim League re-organised itself, and wholeheartedly accepted the idea of Pakistan, passing the Lahore Resolution in 1940. By the time Congress leaders were released from prison in 1945, it was already too late; the rusty Congress Party had to fight an election against the well-oiled Muslim League, which had had enough time to restructure and campaign. In the 1946 election, the League swept the Muslim vote, and the creation of Pakistan became inevitable.
 <br><br>	The Indian ‘Government’ (which was entirely subordinated to the viceroy’s administration), consisted of no Muslim Congress politicians at the behest of Jinnah, who pleaded to the British that the League should be the sole voice of Indian Muslims. The situation was now irredeemable, and, in 1947, the British rushed out of India, leaving behind two countries in the place of one, and a bloodbath caused by communal violence as most Indian Muslims migrated to Pakistan, and Hindu and Sikhs, finding themselves in a hostile =, fundamentalist nation hurried out of the now-Pakistani provinces.
</p>

<h2>Great British Common Sense.</h2>
<p>Pakistan made up 30% of the subcontinent, and so 30% of the British Indian Army went to Pakistan. This was not nearly as logical as it seems; the army was cartoonishly oversized when compared to the population of the fledgling nation, and 75% of its first budget was spent on the maintenance of this gigantic force. The rushed British exit from India set the stage for seven decades (and counting) of bitter violence between the two (later three) nations, both of whom have now armed themselves with nuclear weapons.
 <br><br>	The titanic army, from the very beginning, exerted huge influence over the Pakistani government, and proved that it could and would intervene directly in political affairs with the 1958 coup in which President Major General Iskander Mirza dismissed Constituent Assembly, shortly after which he himself was exiled by General Ayub Khan, who became the first real military dictator of Pakistan.
