During the 2019 election, there is no doubt that the conservative party captured the hearts and minds of the British people by persuading the population to rally behind the idea of “getting Brexit done”. Regardless of its popularity, the racism, discrimination and outright bigotry of the party can not be dismissed. One must ask oneself: Do we really want a government in which the Prime Minister has used slurs to refer to black people and in which immigrants are treated like filth, or do we want equality for all?

<h2><br><br>History </h2>
<p>The Tory party’s history is undeniably one of racism and discrimination to extreme levels. Racism within the party has its origins in the 1960s with examples such as the 1964 campaign poster claiming “If you want a n- for a neighbour, vote labour,” or Enoch Powell’s river of blood speech in which he described the so-called “horrors” of non-white immigrants and the proposed race-relation Bill. During Margaret Thatcher’s term as Prime Minister, this agenda of hatred towards immigrants (especially from former British colonies) continued to persist.<br> In her campaign to be elected she stoked the flames of hate by suggesting immigrants should be feared and was quoted as saying “people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.” </p>

<h2><br><br>Hostile environment </h2>
<p>Islamophobia is defined as a dislike or prejudice against Muslims or Islam and its safe to say this form of discrimination is spread throughout the conservative party. One prime example of this was during the lead up to the 2016 Mayor of London election in which the Current Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan was running for mayor. Then Prime Minister David Cameron and Conservative mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith ran a hateful anti-Muslim smear campaign against Khan and slandered him to try and discredit his campaign. It was claimed that he had links to ISIS and supported Islamic terrorist groups which had no truth behind it at all. Furthermore In October 2018, recently selected London Mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey,  shared an Islamophobic tweet referring to Sadiq Khan as "mad mullah Khan of Londonistan”  Although these incidents are merely the tip of the Iceberg they highlight the extreme Islamophobia within the Party and especially its use for political gain.
</p>

<h2><br><br>Islamophobia</h2>
<p>
So far, there seems to be nothing wrong about intersectionality. However, it is the origins of oppression at which the concept of intersectionality falls short, and becomes sectarian.
 <br>	According to intersectionality, there is no material basis for oppression. Racism exists because white people hate people of colour, not because it was invented as a justification for European colonialism. Sexism exists because men naturally want to oppress women, not because of the (as Engels put it) ‘world historic defeat of the female sex’ upon the creation of class-based society (this claim is especially difficult for advocates of intersectionality to justify, as, prior to the origin of class and the state, humans lived in matriarchal tribes in which there was a gender-based division of labour, but one based on equity rather than sexism).
<br> 	From these theories, one can see the postmodernist origins of intersectionality, in which there’s a sort of Schrödinger’s oppression; oppression is an unalterable reality, but also only exists due to thought and language. Discrimination has not arisen over centuries due to various historical events, but is rather born out of thought, and so the only way to fight it is to change people’s thoughts rather than to change the material conditions which enable said discrimination.
</p>

<h2><br><br>Boris Johnson</h2>
<p>Our current prime minister Boris Johnson has had countless incidents of racism and bigotry, yet still managed to become the leader of the party and the country. When referring to black people he called them "p*ccaninnies" who have "watermelon smiles" as well as claiming that the best thing for Africa would be to bring back colonialism. These deeply offensive comments not only offend black people but also incite the use of slurs and hatred in his voters and fans. Furthermore, in 2018 he controversially compared burqa-wearing Muslim women to "letterboxes" and "bank robbers." On top of that, he is also quoted as saying "islamophobia seems a natural reaction" and "Islam is the problem." These blatantly Islamophobic comments offend, discriminate against and generalise Muslims and should not be tolerated. Some may defend his actions by claiming that these comments only jokes and people shouldn't get offended so easily. However, In the week after Boris Johnson's "letterbox" comments hate crime against Muslims rose by 375 %, showing that these comments simply can not be excused due to the hatred they incite and the actions they result in.
</p>

<h2><br><br>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum it all up in one sentence the tory party holds racist, intolerant views that have no place in modern Britain. As our younger generation reaches voting age we must consider the type of government we want. Although no party is perfect, we must decide whether we truly want the hateful Conservative party in government for another 5 years after the 2024 election or if we want to change the system and its upholders.</p>
