<p> <br>  I am a sixteen year old white male, who has always been morally against racism, but I have never been someone
              who has actively spoken out against the systemic racism that is so prevalent in our society today <p>
                <h3>BEFORE READING</h3>
                <p>You may think that I have had to work hard to gather this information, but really it hasn't been that difficult.<br> Yes, I have spent hours listening and watching things, but finding information on these issues is easier than ever before.<br> Here are some things you can do to better educate yourself on these issues:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/netflix-uk-movies-shows-documentaries-racism-a4459721.htmlS" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-lg active" role="button" aria-pressed="true">Watch documentaries</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/books-about-race-in-britain-to-add-to-your-anti-racist-reading-list-22947864" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-lg active" role="button" aria-pressed="true">Read books</a></p>

<p> I was so shocked when I saw what these monsters were doing to a man who had allegedly handed in a fake $20 bill, one kneeling on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the others allowing this to happen despite the repeated gut-wrenching cries of “I can’t breathe”. I had heard of police brutality and seen videos of people being shot, but this was a different type of police brutality, a much more conscious one where despite George Floyd’s constant pleas to stop and telling these police officers that they were going to kill him, the officer didn't take his knee off Floyd’s neck and the others decided not to act. I knew that for this to have happened there needed to be something fundamentally wrong with the police force in the USA, and so made an effort to find out about this dark history of the people employed to protect the civilians of the country that they serve in.
</p>

      <p> It took me no more than an hour to already have a list as tall as me of the names of BAME people unjustly murdered by the police and white supremacists in the US alone. Some cases stand out to me in particular, one of which is the chase and ensuing murder of 25 year old Ahmaud Arbery. Ahmaud was out jogging on the 23rd February this year in Brunswick, when former County Sheriff of the area, Gregory McMichael told the police that Mr Arbery looked like the suspect in a collection of break-ins. Police have no reports of these alleged break-ins. Having called the police, Gregory and his son Travis armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and chased Arbery in their pick up truck. When they caught up with him, G. McMichael claimed that Arbery attacked his son. Three shots were fired. It took six weeks to arrest them. A blatant murder, on which there is no grounds for self-defence, yet it took six weeks for a police arrest. The elder McMichael, a blatant white supremacist is a former police officer.
<br> <br>

  <h2> The Murder of Breonna Taylor</h2>
 Breonna Taylor was a 26 year old Louisville resident who was shot 8 times after police stormed her house with a no knock warrant, in the middle of the night for an investigation into a drug house far from Ms Taylor’s home. Police say they fired when Kenneth Walker, Ms Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them, a case of attempted murder of a police officer that has since been dismissed. No drugs were found, and while the police say they identified themselves before entering, Ms Taylor’s family have hotly contested this. The lawyers of Taylor have said that the police had already found their main suspect, so why did they feel it necessary to raid the house late at night, possibly without identification. It shows a complete disregard for human life on the police’s part and without body cameras in operation during the raid, the police account doesn't sound too convincing...

  <h2>Final note </h2>
  <p>
    Finally, I would encourage you to talk to those who have experienced this racism on a daily basis. Whether it be your friends, people on online forums or a total stranger. Some of the best insight I have gained is from listening to people whom I have known for multiple years and never talked  to about this issue before. When you understand that your friends have to suffer through harassment and bullying as a normal part of your life, you will realise how the system is geared towards oppressing BAME people and supporting those that are white. I felt a requirement to educate myself and speak up about this after the surfacing of a video where an officer kneels on a black man’s neck and causes his death, just for him using a counterfeit note. I referred to it as a wake up call, but this alarm has been sounding for 400 years, this is just the first time we’ve actually opened our eyes.
