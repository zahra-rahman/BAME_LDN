            <h2>Immigration. </h2>

            <p> That one word, alone, is enough to ruin a dinner. How on earth did we get to a point
where an issue so simple became as divisive as it is today?

<h2> <br><br>Globalism for the capitalist elite; bitter nationalism for the masses.</h2>
  <p>The victims of anti-immigration sentiment vary across the world, but the populist tactics governments
use are almost identical—be it Nigel Farage warning honest, hard-working Britons about Poles,
Syrians and Turks coming to steal their jobs; Narendra Modi accusing migrant workers of all being
terrorists; or Benjamin Netanyahu declaring that Arab-Israelis are, “coming out in droves,” to vote
against him.
<br><br>These nationalist leaders are surprisingly internationalist when it comes to sharing political
strategy, with strong communication with one another and active influence in elections: the Australian
right-wing political strategist Lynton Crosby ran several online campaigns advocating for <a href ="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/grassroots-facebook-brexit-ads-
secretly-run-by-staff-of-lynton-crosby-firm" > hard-
Brexit in 2019  ,</a> whilst BJP I.T. cells sent hundreds of WhatsApp
messages in the run-up to the election, urging British Indians to not vote for the, “Anti-India,” Labour
Party.
<br><br>It should be noted that strategy is not their only international venture; Donald Trump—the
poster-boy for global nationalism, tariffs, and opposition to immigration—owns corporate assets
across the planet, including in Pakistan—a notably Muslim country which was conveniently exempt
from the infamous Muslim travel-ban in the early days of his presidency.
<h2>Bread and conflict.</h2>
<p>Both the Republicans in the U.S. and the Conservatives here in Britain portrayed themselves as parties
of the working-class. A brief glance at the policies of either party would display the irony of such a
claim, but all other factors were somehow out-weighed by immigration. It is a feat of simple
syllogism: A native worker loses their job. Around the same time, some immigrants moved to the
neighbourhood. Therefore, the native worker lost their job to an immigrant.
<br><br>This painful oversimplification becomes even more nonsensical once one realises that other
workers willing to work for less is an issue present throughout the capitalist world, with or without
immigration. It happened nearly every single day during the Great Depression in the United States
(which is expatiated on in several of John Steinbeck’s works, perhaps most conspicuously in ‘The
Grapes of Wrath’), and is a common occurrence regardless of the economic condition. The system
breeds inequality; for every hungry person toiling to earn enough money to buy a sandwich and a
drink, there is a hungrier person willing to settle for just a sandwich, and an even hungrier person who
would do anything for one slice of bread. It would be absurd to criticise the hungry rather than the
system which perpetuates hunger, and it would be even more ludicrous to blame this omnipresent
problem on migrant labourers. Surely it would be more practical for the native worker to unite with
the immigrant worker against exploitative bosses and, in turn, the unequal system?</p>
<h2>
Burning buildings.</h2>

<p>Several supposedly left-wing figures have advocated for ‘stronger’ immigration laws, including Len
McCluskey, general-secretary of Unite the Union, who stated that, “managed immigration,” is needed
to combat the far-right… combating them by doing what they want. Fighting fire with fire burns the
building down.<br><br>
The free movement of international labour should not be hindered; it is a human right for a
person to leave their home in search for a better life, be that within a nation or outside. Instead,
workers’ unity ought to be encouraged, and, as a temporary measure at least, laws should be put in
place to prevent bosses from employing foreign workers for lower wages.<br> Reactionary calls for
‘managed’ or ‘controlled’ immigration are a means for division in the working class, and ought to be
rejected, be they from right-wing ideologues or trade-union bureaucrats.</p>
