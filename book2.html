          <h4>This book blends protest pieces against the establishment and the UK’s policies in dealing people they see as ‘foreign’, with incredibly difficult to read stories of Akala and his friends’ childhoods. These show just how easy it is for even the brightest minds within the black, and by extension underprivileged, communities to fall into a life of crime due to the lack of support they receive from the state</h4>

<h3><br><br>About</h3>
<p> Akala’s story is one of a young black boy with incredible natural intelligence who was stifled by his racist and oppressive teachers in school. The stories of his oppressors and their brutal and insidious methods are etched into Akala’s memory, from him being prodded in the chest whenever he wanted to speak, to having his teacher say to him that the Ku Klux Klan stopped crime by killing black people. He grew up being put in the special needs class, despite his obvious academic prowess due to his teacher’s fear and disapproval of a black boy who was clever.<br> This led Akala to really hate school and his white teachers, which had a detrimental impact on his relationship with his own white mother, emphasising just how pervasive structural racism is and its ability to tear apart even the closest of bonds. Akala witnesses a lot of violence in his youth and is soon carrying a knife. He even gets to the stage where he will attack over a nasty look, something not uncommon for boys growing up in poverty in inner London. He reiterates time and again how lucky he was to get away from that life unscathed and tries his best to repel as many as possible from following in his footsteps, though he realises that for many they will have to find out the terrible reality of gang life for themselves. He understands this because of his ample research into the history of gangs in the UK, showing not only that this is a new phenomenon, but also that it is not an exclusively black lifestyle, but in fact rather a lifestyle synonymous with areas of the highest depreciation, like Glasgow and Liverpool.

<h3>Historical Elements</h3>
<p>The historical elements of this book are backed up with detailed evidence drawn from archives, relatives accounts and diaries of those in power among other things. Akala addresses the slave trade and how the British Media has managed to spin the most dark moment of British history into a victory through lies and propaganda, helped by the disconnection between the colonies and the motherland, as well as the pro-imperial attitudes of the time. <br>He also talks about demonisation of Cuba in relation to post-apartheid South Africa and the admonishing of Castro, all while the West held up authoritarian leaders like General Pinochet in Chile. Akala shines light on the positives of Castro’s Cuba, talking about its influence in bringing an end to the apartheid, as well as its fantastic healthcare system. On the topic of the apartheid he once again exposes the hypocrisy of the British establishment, showing its unequivocal love of Mandela to be farcical by bringing to light the fact that the Mandela statue sits with two of the founding fathers of South African apartheid, Churchill and Jan Smuts.

<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Akala highlights how  both Brexit and the Trump election used racism to win votes before debunking the myth that we live in a post-racial society peddled by the Conservative Party. He also writes about white fragility and the white victim complex. The ‘white victim complex’ is a fear that white, often middle class, people have, that thanks to the meagre attempts to improve the lives of BAME people, they are now disadvantaged. In actuality the whole system is geared towards supporting them and these changes are feeble and inconsequential in the bigger picture of trying to remove the stranglehold white supremacy has on our society.<br> Akala explains this very well combining powerful and intellectual turn of phrase with a relaxed tone and use of colloquialisms to create an extremely cogent argument. Akala also looks to the future, where he sees the East returning to dominance spearheaded by China, with the US having to resort to alliances with India and Japan to keep up. As Akala illustrates, this is a return to normality when looking at the last 1500 years, citing the Qing and Yuan dynasties of China and the Mongol Hordes as evidence. He also sees a less prosperous future for POC living in the UK, with the possibility of the privatisation of the NHS and the ruinous effects of austerity causing many future families to plunge further below the poverty line. However, he does see a way out, through unity and long and hard protests Akala does still believe we can make it out of this mess.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, this book is an essential read if you want to better understand race relations in Britain and the world. It combines horrible personal experience of racism with the empirical facts about it from our own government in an incredibly eloquent way, highlighting not only its normality but also its unwavering place in society over the last four centuries. The book provides a refreshing take on history, a stark contrast from the swathes of upper-middle class white male historians who get so much coverage in today’s world, discussing all of the right things, in all of the right ways. Natives should definitely be at the top of your reading list.</p>
