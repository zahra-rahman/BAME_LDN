            <h2>Indentured labour is a system of unfree labour, whereby workers are bound by a signed or forced contract (indenture) to work without pay for the owner of the indenture for a period of time. </h2>

<h2> <br><br>Who?</h2>
  <p>Indentured labour was frequently used by the British Empire after the abolition of slavery in 1833, where they would force recently freed man and women from South Asia into contracts and then send them out to the colonies to work for next to nothing. Between 1834 and 1917, Britain transported over 2 million indentured Indian workers out to 19 different colonies to work on sugar, cotton and tea plantations.
</p>
<h2>Where?</h2>
<p>Indentured labourers were recruited from India, China and the Pacific and signed a contract to work abroad for 5 years or more. They were promised wages, a small piece of land and ,in some cases, a chance to return home once their contract was over. In reality, conditions were terrible and very few ever got the chance to make their return trip.</p>

<h2>
So why did they agree to this?</h2>

<p>What we must remember is that these people were ex-slaves and so wanted to get out of poverty and the regularity of famine in their homeland. On top of this, nearly all of the slaves were illiterate and so didn’t know the terms of the contract when they signed using their fingerprint. Many of these soon-to-be indentured workers were actually lied to by the British about where they would be working and the wages they would receive.
<br><br>
Conditions on the ships used to transport these workers were terrible, not dissimilar to the conditions on slave ships. In 1856-7 the death rate of Indians travelling to the Caribbean was more than 1 in 6 (17%), as diseases like cholera, measles and dysentery spread quickly across ships. After these ships arrived, there was further death in the holding depot and during the process of acclimatisation in the colonies.

<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The working hours were long and yielded little pay. This took its toll on the already weakened  workers shown by the 12% mortality rate in Jamaica in 1870. Children as young as five were expected to work. An interview from an ex-indentured worker in the Fiji Sun shines some light onto the terrible conditions.“We were whipped for small mistakes. If you woke up late, i.e. later than 3am, you got whipped. No matter what happened, whether there was rain or thunder you had to work - we were here to work and work we had to do, otherwise we were abused and beaten up” (Fiji Sun, 1979)
<br><br>
Many workers attempted to escape this horrible life, but were re-captured and imprisoned, and often had their contracts extended for their attempted escape. At the end of their contract some were able to return home, but many either chose not to or couldn't. Some felt that they wouldn’t be accepted back into their families after such a long time away, but many simply couldn't afford the journey. This is why countries like Jamaica have such large Chinese and Indian populations to this day.
