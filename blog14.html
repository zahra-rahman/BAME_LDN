  When we hear the word ‘swastika’ we tend to think about the Nazis. Despite ending 75 years ago, the tragic events of the Holocaust still haunt us today so it’s unsurprising that a symbol so strongly associated with such a horrific event has been immortalised as a symbol of oppression and cruelty within the Western consciousness.

<p><br><br> However, it’s evident that a large amount of people are unaware of the story behind the Nazi flag, how a symbol now associated with tragedy and violence is in fact a perversion of a symbol representing prosperity and peace. This fact became obvious to me through social media which, as I have mentioned before (read ‘Sexual Assault: Stigma and Disproportionality’), has become a far more popular platform for activism following recent events. An Instagram account had posted an image showing a swastika necklace being sold online, the account calling for the seller (a large clothing company with a large market in Asia) to be boycotted for selling “Nazi propaganda”. As somebody from a religious background, I was aware that the necklace was simply religious material but I was disheartened to see that neither the owner of the account nor the thousands of commenters recognised this seemingly simple fact (which drove me to write this blog).
</p>

<h2><br><br>The Early History of the Swastika</h2>
<p>The swastika has its roots within Eurasian cultures, being found as a prominent religious symbol within Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The word ‘swastika’ is derived from sanskrit (the primary liturgical language of the three aforementioned religions) and translates to ‘conducive to wellbeing’ (a clear contrast to the violence and cruelty now commonly associated with the symbol). The swastika has two important orientations within Hinduism, right-facing (symbolising hope, prosperity or the sun) and left-facing, actually named the ‘sauwastika’, (symbolising the night or relating to Kali, a Hindu goddess). The swastika has existed for millennia, the earliest known use of the word being in the 5th/6th century BCE and the earliest discovered example of the symbol being from 10,000 BCE (indisputably proving that the Nazi Hakenkreuz was not an original invention).</p>


<h2><br><br>The Modern History of the Swastika</h2>
<p>Following the conclusion of World War I, the swastika was adopted in the Western world, its message of prosperity and good faith being one which strongly resonated with people living in a world which had just faced its largest conflict. A postcard sent in June 1910 (created by the Stanford Company in Brooklyn, New York) proudly featured a swastika with the caption: “In ancient days swastika possessed a magic charm and shielded its possessor from danger and harm. To you it brings good wishes, and if I had the power it would bring you all that life holds dear this very day and hour”. The swastika’s popularity was also seen in Germany which is what gave the Nazis their inspiration to create the ‘Hakenkreuz’, the symbol which is commonly, and incorrectly, called a swastika. The Hakenkreuz is noticeably different from the swastika or sauwastika, the ‘arms’ of the shape have been shortened and the shape is set at a 45 degree angle (unlike the religious symbols which are not angled). Following Hitler’s rise to power, the symbol became recognised as one of oppression, violence and racism as a result of the tragic events of World War II and the Holocaust.
</p>

<h2><br><br>The Importance of Education</h2>
<p>When reflecting upon the history of the swastika (and suawastika) it’s clear to see that changing the public perception of a symbol associated with such hardship and pain would be incredibly difficult. The swastika is still used in religious practices today (and rightfully so) but education about the true meaning of the symbol and how it came to be used by the Nazis is important in preventing the emergence of prejudice against those who use it in religious practices (prejudice which I saw in the comments of the Instagram post which drove me to write this blog).

<h2><br><br>The Future</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the significance of the swastika is found within its history, it’s an example of how oppression can scar us, even 75 years later. However, by learning the origin of the swastika and its true meaning we can develop a greater understanding of its significance and perhaps even shape its history in the years to come.
