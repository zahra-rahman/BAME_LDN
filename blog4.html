            <h2>The Role of the UK in Racism</h2>

            <p> Prior to my research into this movement, I knew some of the UK’s terrible past with the slave trade and how it was the backbone of our supposed ‘great’ empire. While yes, this was the past and that was the norm for the time, it continues to baffle me that there are still statues of prolific slave owners and traders erected in city centres, much like the one of Edward Colston, a man who was responsible for the deaths of over 19000 black slaves and branded all of his slaves with the mark of his company using hot irons, which now lies at the bottom of Bristol Harbour, incidentally where lots of his slaves ships came to dock.
            </p>

    <div class="container">

<p> <br> There are of course questions about whether the way that those protestors handled that statue and whether it should be in a museum or not, but the point still stands that none of these statues should be on public view in cities and towns as it upholds these disgusting people as someone of a morally high standard and someone who we should aspire to be. </p>
<h2>Racism Within Modern UK Society</h2>
<p>Clear examples of racism within modern UK society was the treatment of the Windrush generation. Between the late 1940s and early 1960s hundreds of thousands of Afro-Caribbeans sold everything they had, and left their nice life as the middle class in countries like Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad to come to work in the UK.
 What’s important to remember is that these people were British citizens with a British passport, yet they had to pay to travel across the world to seek a better life, while the state subsidised the fees of travelling migrants from European countries like Germany, Italy and France. These people arriving from the Caribbean were the skilled workers who had been given a full education and were doctors and lawyers and accountants back in their homeland. To actually be able to fill out the form you had to be in the top 30% of the population for intelligence (only 30% literacy rate).
 <br>
 These people expected to be paid well and get the jobs they deserved, yet when they arrived, many of them who were qualified nurses in a time where the NHS was struggling to get off its feet, were forced to work as cleaners or binmen or bus drivers, far below their skill level. They couldn’t get jobs because of the colour of their skin, and had to struggle far more than they ever did back in their homeland. They had been told a lie. This endemic racism still exists within the workplace today, as shown by the fact that if your name sounds ‘black’, then you are 50% less likely to get an interview than someone with exactly the same level of qualifications who has a white sounding name.
</p>

<h2>Police Racism in the UK</h2>
<p>There is also still a lot of police racism in the UK. As a young black man you are 13 times more likely to be stopped than someone like me who is of similar age but white. There is a lot of talk of ‘Black on Black violence, but truthfully it makes up a very small percentage of the violence on UK streets. The gang problem in London at the moment is not because of race, but because of class. Over the decades in the UK, there have been these problems across the country and often the violence is not between black people<br>
  Examples of this are: the violence in Glasgow in the late 90s and early 2000s, gangs on the streets of 1920s Sheffield and 1900s Leeds and one that is more present in modern day society: the gangs in Birmingham in the late 19th century, which the hit show ‘Peaky Blinders’ is based on.
</p>
<h2>  The common denominator here is not race, it’s poverty, yet the media continue to label this issue as a ‘black thing’.</h2>

<h4> In fact it's not a poverty issue, it’s a government issue </h4>
<p>as the culture of expulsion within inner city schools is setting these children up for a prison sentence, unless they have a particular talent in music or sports, excessive arresting of people whom the police know not to be the issue (ie. they will be able to tell which black kids will be the ones offending, yet still choose to arrest young black males who are innocent) creates a collective hatred for the police and a desire to rebel.</p>
