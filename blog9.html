            <h2>Following the death of George Floyd... </h2><p> There has been a rapid and unprecedented surge in support for movements such
as Black Lives Matter as well as an increased awareness of the power of the police force

        (and the abuse of said
power), particularly in the United States (although the issue is not contained to that one country).</p>

<h2><br><br> Realities of Abuse of Power</h2>
<p>
  Social media has always been a platform for sharing information but the type of information shared has become far more educational
  than ever before. The topic of crime, and how we should deal with it, has now been pushed to the forefront of the
  public eye. <br><br>
  It’s clear that the police have an overabundance of power which they have frequently used to abuse the
  general public (specifically those within minority groups). For example, data from the FBI’s Supplementary
  Homicide Report (from 2012) highlighted that black people compose 13% of the US population yet they account for
  a wildly disproportionate 31% of all people killed by American police officers.
  <br><br> In the UK, 163 people have died in
  police custody or following it in the past 10 years (according to the Independent Office for Police Conduct). Of
  those 163, 23 were from BAME groups.<br> Only 11% of the UK population is BAME (according to the 2011 United
  Kingdom Census) yet they made up 14% of the deaths as found in this study. Unfortunately, this UK study only
  covered statistics related to police custody meaning that the total number of police killings is certainly higher (and I
  would suspect that the disproportionality between the treatment of BAME individuals as compared to others is also
  much larger).
</p>


<h2>Sex as a Taboo</h2>
<p>However, one type of crime which hasn’t been highlighted as strongly as police brutality is sexual crime. The topic
of rape and sexual assault as a whole is incredibly sensitive, most likely stemming from the fact that sex is a taboo
talking point in our society.<br><br>
 The fact that sex is a topic which is actively avoided leads to a large number of issues
ranging from smaller problems (such as confusion regarding intercourse itself) to larger issues (such as
misinformation regarding consent).<br> There have been numerous studies regarding not only the perpetrators of rape
but also the victims of such an assault and the physical and/or psychological impact that sexual assault creates.</p>

<h2>Victims, Rapists and Convictions</h2>
<p>Analysis of United States data derived from Justice Department National Crime Victimization Surveys (from 2010
to 2014) by RAINN (the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) discovered only 31% of rape incidents are
reported to the police Furthermore, the study found that a staggeringly low 0.6% of convicted rapists are
incarcerated.<br><br> Contrastingly, analyses of Justice Department National Crime Victimization Surveys (from 2009 to
2012) found that the impacts of sexual assault on the victims are far more damaging. 75% of victims experienced
significant problems with work, family and friends, 30-50% suffered from depression and 30-45% contemplated
suicide (with 5-15% attempting suicide).<br><br> Statistics found by the UK Home Office found that a shocking 98% of
alleged sexual assailants (reported to the police) face no consequences. The number of sex crimes recorded by UK
police rose by 9 per cent between 2017 and 2018 yet the number of prosecuted sexual offences (in the UK) dropped
by over 4,000 in the same period.<br><br> Unfortunately, the real number of sexual assault incidents is undoubtedly much
larger than these statistics suggest due to the fact that over two thirds of sexual assault incidents aren’t reported (as
highlighted by the aforementioned analysis of US statistics by RAINN).

<h2>Shocking Stats Explained...</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons behind the horrifically low rate of convictions of sexual assailants, one of which is
the dismissive attitudes of judges in courts of law. For example, a BBC News report published in February 2020
detailed the story of a British woman who objected to her former partner being granted time with their son (due to
the fact that he had previously assaulted and raped her).
<br><br> Judge Robin Tolson (who presided over the hearing) stated
that the woman "was not in any sense pinned down", she "could easily, physically, have made life harder" for the
man and it "did not constitute rape". The woman later lost the legal battle against her partner. This story only
scratches the surface of the outdated, bigoted and downright damaging attitudes which are so frequently found
within courts of law and within others in powerful positions (such as US president Donald Trump, who dismissed
the high rates of sexual assault in the military in May 2013 by stating, “What did these geniuses expect when they
put men & women together?”).
<br><br> Moreover, whilst all 50 US states deem rape by a police officer to be illegal, 35 of
those states lack laws which expressly define sex between police officers and detainees as non-consensual. This
inevitably and sadly leads to people being sexually assaulted by police officers since a victim’s claims will almost
certainly be dismissed. This is not only shown by the already low rate of assailant prosecution but also because
police officers possess more power than an average citizen, especially due to the lack of these fundamental laws,
thus can abuse said power to gain a far greater influence within a court of law.
<br><br>Finally, I would suspect that the
blatant disproportionality between the treatment of BAME individuals and others mentioned throughout this post
makes them more likely to be targets and victims of sexual assault by police officers (since the likelihood of an
officer being convicted from a claim made by a BAME individual is significantly lower).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, sexual assault is a far-reaching and worsening issue which is fueled by stigma and the historic abuse
of power and the legal system. Removing the stigma surrounding sex, sexual assault and other related topics (a
responsibility which falls upon us as individuals) as well as increasing the priority of education about consent in
schools are critical steps in the journey to raising the percentage of reported sexual assaults and, more crucially,
raising the percentage of convicted sexual assailants.</p>
